* i used a lot of map to avoid hard coding the page and change the content at personal choices 

* try to reduce the screen size to see the difference 

* for the element7 i didn't really put muh effort in it for the rest part 

* i made sure that reseizing the page doesn't affect the context that much 

* i want added @media to make it look perfect but i really didn't have much time 

* every part of the main page is an element 

* i didn't wanna usestate for hover and onchange to not complicate it and it will take time so i didn't do it
